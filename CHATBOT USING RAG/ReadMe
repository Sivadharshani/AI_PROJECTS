Chatbot Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
This project implements a chatbot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on content extracted from PDFs. 
The system integrates document preprocessing, chunking, document embeddings with FAISS, and response generation using pretrained DPR and T5 models from Hugging Face. 

Features:
1.Extracts text from PDFs using `pdfplumber`.
2.Builds a semantic search index with FAISS for document retrieval.
3.Generates context-aware answers using the `T5` language model.

Usage:
Upload a PDF, query the chatbot, and get detailed, context-aware responses. Perfect for automating question answering from research papers, reports, and more.
