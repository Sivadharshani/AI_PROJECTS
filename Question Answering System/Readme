This repository contains a Python-based Question Answering System using BERT and dense retrieval technique. 
It employs DistilBERT for extracting answers from the context and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for finding the most relevant passage based on semantic similarity.  

  Features include:  
1. Dense retrieval using cosine similarity to identify relevant contexts.  
2. Answer extraction from the most relevant passage.  
3. Pre-trained models like DistilBERT and SBERT for efficiency and accuracy.
